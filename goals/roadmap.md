# Roadmap

## Phase 1: First Month — Theoretic Deep Dive + Personal Pet Project

- Focus on deep theoretical understanding of backend architecture, API design, and general full-stack principles.
- Self-driven development of a personal pet project:
  - **Domain:** Movie catalog with real-time chat functionality.
  - **Tech stack:** WebSockets for real-time communication, standard REST for API design.
  - Purpose: apply learned principles hands-on and build practical experience alongside theory.

## Phase 2: Second and Third Month — Mentor-Guided Pet Project

- Initiate a new pet project proposed by the mentor.
- Main focus areas:
  - Collaborative development.
  - Advanced architecture patterns.
  - More complex real-world scenarios.
  - Exposure to team workflows and professional development practices.
- Goal: simulate a more production-like environment and prepare for actual team contribution.

The roadmap is intentionally split into solo and mentor-driven phases to balance theory, self-application, and collaborative learning.
