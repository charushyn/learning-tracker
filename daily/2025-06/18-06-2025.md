## Daily Status: [Date - 18.06]

### 🧑‍🏭 Learning Progress

- Consolidated and practiced core backend concepts:
  - Designed and implemented **Data Models**.
  - Applied **RESTful API Principles** in practice.
  - Handled incoming **Requests** and routed them properly.
  - Structured code with a **Services Layer** for better separation of concerns.
  - Implemented **CRUD Operations** (Read, Create only).
  - Configured and used **Environment Variables (ENV)** for flexible configuration.
  - Built a small **MVC architecture example** to organize code for better maintainability and cleaner structure.

### 🚧 Challenges/Blockers (if any)

### 📅 Plans for Tomorrow's Learning

- Move into **Enhancing API Functionality & Robustness**:
  - Implement **Middleware** for request preprocessing.
  - Add **Error Handling** to standardize and simplify debugging.
  - Work on **Loading Lists** (e.g., pagination, limiting results).
  - Explore **Aggregations** for more efficient and powerful data queries.

### 🤝 Interactions/Meetings

I had first meeting with all guys from intership, that was cool!

### 📝 Notes (Optional)

- MVC structure helped to see how separating concerns simplifies debugging and improves scalability.
- The service layer feels like a sweet spot between controller logic and direct DB access.
